## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS animations
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned more about CSS animations and discovered the Picture HTML 5 element.
This was the first time I developed something using a mobile-first workflow and plan to use the workflow in future projects.

### Continued development

Continue learning about CSS animations and practicing with CSS grid.
